Exapyte Testing Roadmap: TDD Approach for MVP Development
Overview
This document outlines a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to evolve the Exapyte distributed data platform from a basic demonstration to a fully featured Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The testing strategy progresses from unit tests to integration tests, ensuring quality and functionality at each step.
Testing Tools & Frameworks

pytest: Core testing framework
pytest-asyncio: For testing async functions
pytest-anyio: For testing code that uses anyio
pytest-cov: For measuring code coverage
pytest-mock: For mocking dependencies

Phase 1: Core Component Unit Testing
Storage Layer Testing
Scenario: In-Memory Storage Operations

Given an initialized MemoryStore instance
When basic operations are performed (get, set, delete)
Then the operations should work as expected
Why: The storage layer is foundational - all other components depend on reliable data storage
